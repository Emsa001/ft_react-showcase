# Showcase Repository

This repository was originally created for the **ft_react** project. However, due to the accumulation of unnecessary libraries and complexity in the showcase code, it has since been repurposed as a general **showcase** repository.

If you're looking for the original **ft_react** project, you can find it here:

## About

This repository now serves as a space to explore and demonstrate various front-end concepts, experiments, and UI components. It may contain a mix of examples, prototypes, or snippets, and is no longer tied to the original scope of the ft_react curriculum.

## Note

The history of this project includes dependencies and files that were relevant only to the ft_react setup. Please refer to the new [ft_react repository](https://github.com/Emsa001/ft_react) for a clean and dedicated version of that project.
